*) Save reminder on exit if data has been modified.

*) XML overwrite warning. Ctrl+S has no file dialog, won't ask, destroying existing foreign file!

*) Table items UI: Add filtering.
   Current workaround: sort by title, category etc. - click colum header twice after load.
   That way, already annotated items appear on top of the list.

*) Add UI to modify value formatting (decimal places).
   There's a little bit of fixed automatic logic in code.

*) Add UI to display/adjust/toggle table record multiplier + offset.
   Currently not displayed at all, only appear in RR XML export.

*) gnuplot: Investigate using gnuplot variable to set temporary binary file path if possible.
   That way standard temporary file would work and main plot commands can remain in easy-to-edit template.

*) gnuplot: consider adding more export formats (PDF, EPS, PNG, ...)

*) Table items UI: Remove check mark column if it isn't going to be used in the future.

*) ScoobyRom XML: Automatically set and save table search range.

*) Add UI for ROM info (xmlid) lines. Plus copy & paste via clipboard maybe.

*) Update 2D graph on metadata change automatically - drawing 2D is fast.

*) Add IDC script generation features.
