*) Add CVN calculation methods for gasoline ECU ROMs.

*) Make some properties adjustable.
   E.g. validation min/max numbers, take file size into account etc.

*) Inprove search performance.

*) Improve success probability.
   Might use more range overlap checking to increase table type detection accuracy.

*) Remove metadata fields from ROM specific table record structs.
   Use wrapper class/struct in UI app instead.
   That way library and UI app don't need so much type features synchronization.

*) Add more IDA (IDC script) features.
