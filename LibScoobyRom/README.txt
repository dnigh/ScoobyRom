2) Purpose
==========
Main library for ScoobyRom, provides ROM file logic.
Independent from user interface stuff.
Ideally this library would get cleanup and separation from ScoobyRom.
Currently some features are closely related to what the UI app needs.


3) Installation
===============
Nothing to do as it is part of the "solution", compiled and copied automatically.
See ScoobyRom application project.


4) Dependencies
===============
Standard .NET base libraries only.
Uses VS 2010 (.NET 4.0) project file format, same as ScoobyRom.
This library however does not seem to use any new .NET 4.0 features yet
so .NET 3.5 should be sufficient.
